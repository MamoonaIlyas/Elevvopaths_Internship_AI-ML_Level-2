Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction Description         
Task 5:  Movie Recommendation System Description

üìå Projects Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Synthetic Cover Type Classification ‚Äì Random Forest & XGBoost

Goal:
To generate a synthetic dataset with numerical and categorical features, train classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost), visualize results, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

Key Steps:

Generate synthetic environmental features (elevation, slope, distance to road, etc.).

Preprocess data using ColumnTransformer with scaling and one-hot encoding.

Train and evaluate:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Visualize:

Confusion matrix

Feature importance

Perform GridSearchCV to optimize XGBoost parameters.

Skills & Libraries Used:
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn

2Ô∏è‚É£ Loan Approval Prediction ‚Äì Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE

Goal:
To simulate a loan application dataset with missing values and class imbalance, preprocess it, handle imbalance using SMOTE, and compare Logistic Regression & Decision Tree models.

Key Steps:

Simulate categorical and numerical loan applicant data.

Handle missing values using SimpleImputer.

Encode categorical variables with OneHotEncoder.

Standardize numerical features with StandardScaler.

Address class imbalance using SMOTE.

Train and evaluate:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Visualize confusion matrix for decision tree results.

Discuss importance of metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) on imbalanced data.

Skills & Libraries Used:
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, imblearn, matplotlib

3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Systems ‚Äì Collaborative Filtering & Matrix Factorization

Goal:
To simulate a movie rating dataset (similar to MovieLens 100K) and implement different recommendation algorithms.

Implemented Approaches:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)

Matrix Factorization using SVD

Key Steps:

Generate synthetic user-movie rating matrix.

Calculate cosine similarity for users and items.

Implement recommendation logic for UBCF and IBCF.

Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for latent factor analysis.

Evaluate UBCF recommendations using Precision@K.

Skills & Libraries Used:
numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy
